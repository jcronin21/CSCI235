4. what do you notice about the difference between the times for psum1 and psum2,
and what effect does increasing the number of threads have on each? What do you make of those results?



5a. Do you need the mutex on accesses of a[i]? Why or why not? Do you need the mutex on changes to sum? Why or why not?


5b. In a comment below the table and your other comments so far, what do you notice about the difference between the times
for psum2 and psum3, and what effect does increasing the number of threads have on each? What do you make of those results?


6.what do you notice about the difference between the times for psum3 and psum4, and what effect does increasing the number
of threads have on each? What do you make of those results, and how can you relate it to Lab10?
