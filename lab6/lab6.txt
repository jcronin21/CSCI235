what C function would you use if you wanted to read in a file line-by-line
(instead of character-by-character as we did in the previous problem)?

-- I would use getline or fgets
-- However,I am a bit confused with getline. Does that only return
-- the line length?

Update your lab6.txt to indicate what you finished and what your my_grep.c does,
including anything you attempted but were unable to finish or debug. Also include
whatever limitations / design decisions you made for your my_grep.c

-- my_grep.c program iterates through each char in the array and compares it to 
-- string_to_find. then if a match is found in string_to_find it prints string_to_find.
