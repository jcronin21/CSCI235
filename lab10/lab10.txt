Using your mtest2 executable, multiply some matrices. In your lab10.txt:


Document at least four runs of mtest with different matrix dimensions
Suggestion: mtest 500 500 500 500


What can you say about the performance of mtest2 and your three matrix multiply algorithms?


Did your implementations of ijk, kij, and jki match the predicted performance in the slides? If not, why do you suppose that is?


Last week, an article was posted about matrix multiplication efficiency.
The article stated that optimizing matrix multiplication was difficult,
and that it took an AI 50 years to come up with an improvement. Is there
a difference between what that article was discussing and what is going on here? Explain your answer.
